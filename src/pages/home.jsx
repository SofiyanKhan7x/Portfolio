          I am an MCA student at MIT Aurangabad, specializing in backend
          development. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as
          Java and Python, as well as web development skills in HTML and CSS, I
          am passionate about building efficient and scalable backend systems.
          My expertise also includes working with RDBMS for effective database
          management. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world
          projects and am continuously learning to stay updated with the latest
          technological advancements. My goal is to contribute to meaningful
          projects and grow as a backend developer. Outside of tech, I am a NCC
          Senior Under Officer.
